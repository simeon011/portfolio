    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
       Hello, my name is Simeon. If you are reading this, it means you are visiting my portfolio website. My interest in programming began in high school, where I first encountered it. We mainly studied C#, which gave me a solid foundation to start my journey. 
       I am currently studying at the Technical University of Sofia, majoring in “Information Systems in Industry.” At university, I have worked with a variety of programming languages, including Python, Java, C, C++, as well as databases like MySQL, and even CNC programming. 
       Among all of these, Python impressed me the most and became my favorite. In my second year, I decided to enroll in SoftUni’s Python path, where I also gained experience with PostgreSQL and its integration with Python. 
       If you’d like to see my progress so far, you can check the <a href="certificates.html">“Certificates”</a> section. During my studies, I also got to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript more closely, in order to fully understand Python Web development. 
       This is my story in short – young, ambitious, and motivated to grow in the IT field, specifically in backend development. I am always ready to learn new things and determined to achieve my goals.
