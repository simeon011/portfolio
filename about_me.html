       <!-- Hello, my name is Simeon. If you are reading this, it means you are visiting my portfolio website. My interest in programming began in high school, where I first encountered it. We mainly studied C#, which gave me a solid foundation to start my journey. 
       I am currently studying at the Technical University of Sofia, majoring in “Information Systems in Industry.” At university, I have worked with a variety of programming languages, including Python, Java, C, C++, as well as databases like MySQL. 
       Among all of these, Python impressed me the most and became my favorite. In my second year, I decided to enroll in SoftUni’s Python path, where I also gained experience with PostgreSQL and its integration with Python. 
       If you’d like to see my progress so far, you can check the <a href="certificates.html">“Certificates”</a> section. During my studies, I also got to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript more closely, in order to fully understand Python Web development. 
       This is my story in short – young, ambitious, and motivated to grow in the IT field, specifically in backend development. I am always ready to learn new things and determined to achieve my goals. -->

        Hello, my name is Simeon. My journey into the world of programming began in high school, where I first encountered C#. This early exposure provided me with a solid logical foundation and sparked a passion that led me to the Technical University of Sofia, where I am currently majoring in "Information Systems in Industry." 
        Throughout my university studies, I have gained experience with a wide range of languages, including Java, C, C++, and MySQL, but it was Python that truly impressed me with its elegance and vast possibilities.
        To transform this passion into professional expertise, I enrolled in the specialized Python track at SoftUni. It was during this intensive training that I built a comprehensive understanding of backend development, 
        with a primary focus on the Django framework. I gained solid, hands-on knowledge of PostgreSQL, mastering how to integrate and manage relational databases directly within Django applications. To complement my backend skills, 
        I also dived deep into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I pursued these frontend technologies not just to build interfaces, but to fully grasp the entire web ecosystem and understand how a server-side framework like Django powers a complete, seamless user experience.
        Today, I am a young, ambitious developer. I am constantly driven to learn new technologies and determined to apply my academic and practical skills to solve complex real-world problems.
